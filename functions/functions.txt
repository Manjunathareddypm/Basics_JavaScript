A function is block of code that performs a specific task.

A JavaScript function is excecuted when something "Invokes it"(call it).

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.


A function in javascript is similar to a procedure - a set of Statements that performs a task or calulate a value, 
but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious
relationship b/w the input and the output.To use a function, you must define it somwhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
Functions are reuseable as they can be defined once and can be called with different values resulting in different result
