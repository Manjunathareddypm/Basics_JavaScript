The promise is a solution to asynchronous (non-synchronous) writing, which is more elegant than the original callback writing.

In the early days, it was a suite of the open-source community, and later it was incorporated into the language standard.

And ES8 (ES2017) releases a more perfect async, await, which directly makes asynchronous writing like synchronization.

The disadvantage is that when thoughts fall on complex business logic, await is sometimes missed, and errors are found at runtime.
