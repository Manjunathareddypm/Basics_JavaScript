JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop
which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. 
This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.

Event loop works on stact, queue, node api

firstly the statements will be excecuted in stack and ends

At the time of excecution all the function will be collected by the node api

later node api will pass the function to the queue

then queue will check for stack is empty are not if it is empty

then queue will pass the function to the stack then it will be excecuted.
