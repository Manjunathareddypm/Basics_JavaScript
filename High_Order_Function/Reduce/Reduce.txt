The reduce method executes the callback function on each member of the calling array which results in a single output value. The reduce method accepts two parameters: 1) The reducer function (callback), 2) and an optional initialValue.

The reducer function (callback) accepts four parameters: accumulator, currentValue, currentIndex, sourceArray.

If an initialValue is provided, then the accumulator will be equal to the initialValue and the currentValue will be equal to the first element in the array.

If no initialValue is provided, then the accumulator will be equal to the first element in the array and the currentValue will be equal to the second element in the array.
