let :- variables declared with "let" keyword. it cannot be redeclared with same variable name in a same scope 
but we can reassign the value of that variable. we can redeclare the same variable name in other Scope. but it sholud not be in same scope.

Ex:- let a = 10
     let a = 20                // There will be an error
    console.log(a)

Ex:-  let a = 10
        a = 20
        console.log(a)         // it works fine output will be 20

Ex:-    let b = 10
        function showNumber(){     
            let b = 20              // it works fine because scope of Variable is different it is not in same scope. o/p will be 20
            console.log(b);
        }
        showNumber()

const :- variables declared with "const" keyword. it cannot be redeclared or reassign the value with same variable name in a same scope 
we can redeclare the same variable name in other Scope. but it sholud not be in same scope.

  Ex:-       const d = 10
             const d = 20             // There will be an error because of Redeclaration
             console.log(d)                 


 Ex:-    const e = 10
         e = 20                     // There will be an error saying that Assignment to constant variable.
         console.log(e)



 Ex:-   const f = 100
        console.log(f)                //o/p will be 100


 Ex:-   const g = 10
        function showNumber(){     
            const g = 20              // it works fine because scope of Variable is different it is not in same scope. o/p 20
            console.log(g);
        }
        showNumber()


var :- variables declared with "var" keyword. it can be redeclared or reassign the value with same variable name in a same scope or
we can redeclare the same variable name in other Scope as well.


Ex:-         var  x = 10
             var  x = 20             //o/p is 20
             console.log(x)                 


 Ex:-    var e = 10
         e = 20                     //o/p is 20
         console.log(e)



 Ex:-   var f = 100
        console.log(f)                //o/p will be 100


 Ex:-   var g = 10
        function showNumber(){     
            var g = 20              // o/p is 20
            console.log(g);
        }
        showNumber()
