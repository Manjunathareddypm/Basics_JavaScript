Synchronous 

Blocking method is execute Synchronous, that means it execute line by line.
this maintains stack LIFO order that means Last In First Out, suppose if we have f1, f2, f3 functions first it will excecute f1 then f2 then f3 order.


Asynchronous JavaScript

Non-Blocking method is execute Asynchronous, The word asynchronous means not occurring at the same time
Typically, executing things in sequence works well. 
But you may sometimes need to fetch data from the server or execute a function with a delay, something you do not anticipate occurring NOW. 
So, you want the code to execute asynchronously.
